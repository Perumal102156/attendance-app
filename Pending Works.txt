1) HP 5140291004 need to followup with HP Team..

2) Laptop need to allocate to nellamangala employee.(mouse we need to collect back)

3) Laptop need to allocate for Hydrabad employee.






The issue has been resolved by replacing the SSD and reinstalling the operating system along with all required software.

I have configured the laptop with the appropriate username as per company standards and completed all necessary setup. The device is now ready for use.

Hence, we are closing the ticket.

Thanks & Regards, Venkat
